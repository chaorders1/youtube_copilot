00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.293
So I'm Sam, and I'm one of the researchers

00:00:02.293 --> 00:00:03.420
here at Anthropic.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.797
Computer use is something that we felt

00:00:05.797 --> 00:00:07.215
was gonna be important for a while now.

00:00:07.215 --> 00:00:08.508
And so, today we're gonna be talking about

00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:10.552
a very early version we
have of computer use.

00:00:10.552 --> 00:00:12.595
And walking through a
representative example

00:00:12.595 --> 00:00:14.431
of the things we think
it's gonna be useful for.

00:00:20.812 --> 00:00:24.649
We're gonna be going
through a quick demo today.

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:26.901
In this fictional demo, a customer,

00:00:26.901 --> 00:00:28.653
in this case, the Ant Equipment Company,

00:00:28.653 --> 00:00:30.447
has come to us and asked us

00:00:30.447 --> 00:00:32.532
to fill out a vendor request form.

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:35.785
The data I need to fill
out this form is scattered

00:00:35.785 --> 00:00:37.620
in various places on my computer.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.207
What we're gonna do is ask
Claude to look at a spreadsheet,

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:43.460
check if Ant Equipment is in there.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.295
And if not, move over to the CRM

00:00:45.295 --> 00:00:47.380
and try and find some
more information there.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.674
Once it has this data,
Claude's gonna then fill out

00:00:49.674 --> 00:00:52.761
the form for us, and hopefully
transfer the information

00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:54.929
across to the vendor form.

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:55.972
The first thing that's gonna happen

00:00:55.972 --> 00:00:58.141
is Claude's gonna start taking
screenshots of my screen,

00:00:58.141 --> 00:01:00.643
and quickly realizes that
the Ant Equipment Company

00:01:00.643 --> 00:01:02.395
isn't actually in the spreadsheet.

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:04.731
So the first thing it does
is it swaps over to a CRM

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:07.150
and searches for the
company we're interested in.

00:01:18.536 --> 00:01:19.954
Luckily, we get a search match.

00:01:19.954 --> 00:01:22.457
And Claude then starts
scrolling through the page,

00:01:22.457 --> 00:01:23.666
looking for all the information it needs

00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:24.751
to fill out this form.

00:01:31.716 --> 00:01:33.551
Claude then autonomously
starts transferring

00:01:33.551 --> 00:01:36.054
the information across without
me having to do anything.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.267
And goes through the steps,

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:43.353
and fills out all the information needed.

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:49.567
And then submits the form.

00:01:49.567 --> 00:01:52.654
This example is representative
of a lot of drudge work

00:01:52.654 --> 00:01:53.780
that people have to do.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.240
This is available in the API.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.574
We're excited for people to try it,

00:01:56.574 --> 00:01:58.827
and we should expect
things to get a lot better

00:01:58.827 --> 00:01:59.869
over the coming months.
