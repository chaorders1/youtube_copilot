I'm Alex, I lead developer
relations at Anthropic,

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.839
and today I'm gonna be
showing you a coding task

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:06.923
with computer use.

00:00:14.222 --> 00:00:17.475
So we're gonna be showing Claude
doing a website coding task

00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:19.769
by actually controlling my laptop.

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:21.021
But before we start coding,

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:24.274
we need an actual website for
Claude to make changes to.

00:00:24.274 --> 00:00:27.527
So, let's ask Claude to
navigate to claude.ai

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:29.112
within my Chrome browser,

00:00:29.112 --> 00:00:31.573
and ask Claude within claude.ai

00:00:31.573 --> 00:00:34.909
to create a fun, 90s themed
personal homepage for itself.

00:00:37.912 --> 00:00:39.122
Claude opens Chrome,

00:00:41.624 --> 00:00:43.043
searches for claude.ai,

00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:49.674
and then types in a prompt
asking the other Claude

00:00:49.674 --> 00:00:51.718
to create a personal homepage for itself.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.685
Claude.ai returns some code,

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.899
and that gets nicely rendered

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:08.234
in an Artifact on the right-hand side.

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:09.194
That looks great,

00:01:09.194 --> 00:01:11.780
but I want to make a few
changes to the website locally

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:12.947
on my own computer.

00:01:12.947 --> 00:01:15.283
Let's ask Claude to download the file

00:01:15.283 --> 00:01:17.243
and then open it up in VS Code.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.081
Claude clicks the save to file button,

00:01:22.874 --> 00:01:24.209
opens up VS Code,

00:01:26.836 --> 00:01:29.798
and then finds the file
within my Downloads folder

00:01:29.798 --> 00:01:30.632
and opens it up.

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:34.928
Perfect.

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:36.179
Now that the file's up and running,

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:38.389
let's ask Claude to start up a server

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:41.267
so that we can actually view
the file within our browser.

00:01:45.522 --> 00:01:48.733
Claude opens up the VS Code terminal

00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:50.193
and tries to start a server.

00:01:53.446 --> 00:01:54.531
But it hits an error,

00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:57.075
we don't actually have Python
installed on our machine.

00:01:57.075 --> 00:01:57.909
But that's all right,

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.327
because Claude realizes this

00:01:59.327 --> 00:02:00.954
by looking at the terminal output,

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:02.997
and then tries again with Python 3,

00:02:02.997 --> 00:02:05.041
which we do have installed on our machine.

00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:07.544
That works, so now the
server's up and running.

00:02:07.544 --> 00:02:09.045
Now that we have the local server started,

00:02:09.045 --> 00:02:11.131
we can go manually take
a look at the website

00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:12.507
within the browser,

00:02:12.507 --> 00:02:13.550
and it looks pretty good,

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.468
but I notice that
there's actually an error

00:02:15.468 --> 00:02:16.469
in the terminal output,

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:19.472
and we also have this missing
file icon at the top here.

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:22.225
Let's ask Claude to identify this error

00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:24.144
and then fix it within the file.

00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:26.604
Claude visually reads the terminal output

00:02:26.604 --> 00:02:29.816
and opens up the find and
replace tool in VS Code

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:32.861
to find the line that's
throwing the actual error.

00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:33.695
In this case,

00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:35.655
we just ask Claude to get
rid of the error entirely,

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:37.824
so it will just delete the whole line.

00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:39.659
Then, Claude will save the file

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.203
and automatically rerun the website.

00:02:42.203 --> 00:02:43.663
So now that the error is gone,

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:45.748
let's go take a final look at our website,

00:02:45.748 --> 00:02:48.585
and we can see that the
file icon has disappeared

00:02:48.585 --> 00:02:51.171
and the error is gone as well.

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:52.005
Perfect.

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:54.174
So that's coding with
computer use and Claude.

00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:55.633
This took a few prompts now,

00:02:55.633 --> 00:02:56.926
but we can imagine in the future

00:02:56.926 --> 00:02:59.262
that Claude will be able to
do tasks like this end to end.
