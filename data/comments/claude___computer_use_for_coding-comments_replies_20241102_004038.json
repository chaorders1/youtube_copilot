Though I have to wonder - is Claude watching me reply to your comment about Claude watching the video?

While that would technically create more space, there are much safer ways to free up storage on Windows 11. I actually have a video on disk cleanup tips that won't erase your entire system! If you'd like, I can share some quick space-saving tricks that are a bit less... destructive than our friend Claude's suggestion. 🖥️✨"
