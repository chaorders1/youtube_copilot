Video Description:
With the upgraded Claude 3.5 Sonnet, we’re introducing a new capability in beta: computer use. Developers can now direct Claude to use computers the way people do—by looking at a screen, moving a cursor, clicking, and typing text.

While groundbreaking, computer use is still experimental—at times cumbersome and error-prone. We're releasing computer use early for feedback from developers.

In this demo, Claude creates a themed website—generating code, launching a server, and fixing its own mistakes.

Claude is generating all the computer actions shown here. 

This demonstration was recorded in a controlled environment, with some supporting infrastructure simplified to highlight the core capabilities.
